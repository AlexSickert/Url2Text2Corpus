# Url2Text2Corpus

## Background

In order to create a corpus of a specific language We can take a newspaper or blog URL. We then load the main page, read the html content, extract the words and sentences as well as HTML links. We then follow the HTML links provided they match certain criteria. We repeat this until we want to stop or until there are not further links.
